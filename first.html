     <p> 
       <div>
       <ol>
         <li>Selector: The selector points to the html element you want to style.</li>
         <li>Declaration: color- The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</li>
         <li>Declaration: amount/quantity-</li>
       </ol>
       </div>
     </p>
     <h2>CSS Specificity</h2>
     <h1>What is Specificity?</h1>
     <p>If there are two or more conflicting CSS rules that point to the same element, the browser follows some rules to determine which one is most specific and therefore wins out.
 
 Think of specificity as a score/rank that determines which style declarations are ultimately applied to an element.
 
 The universal selector (*) has low specificity, while ID selectors are highly specific! 
 
 Note: Specificity is a common reason why your CSS-rules don't apply to some elements, although you think they should.
